              <h4>Data collection</h4>

              <p>
                Data collection  We collect only personally identifiable information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors
                to this website. Sustify receives limited identifiable information, such as name, Title, company
                address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers, from website visitors. Typically, identifying
                information is collected to:</p>
              <ul style="list-style-type:circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                <li>Inquire for further information</li>
                <li>Submit resumes</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Demographic information, including gender and occupation, is not actively sought, but may be submitted when a visitor responds
                to an online job application. It is Sustify's policy to limit the information collected to only
                the minimum information required to complete a visitor's request. In any instance where non-mandatory
                information is sought, the website visitor will be notified of this at the point of collection.
                Visitors are also able to send email through the site. Their messages will contain the user's
                screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include
                in the message. Because we use the website as a recruiting tool, a visit to the website may also
                result in the user sending a resume to an individual within Sustify. Sustify's intention is not
                to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required for recruiting
                purposes. Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic
                origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical
                or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. We suggest that you do not provide sensitive
                information of this nature. If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, Sustify
                accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement
                or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.

              </p>
              <h4>Use of data</h4>
              <p>A user may choose to provide personal information in the following examples:</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                  <li> Submit resumes or work history information
                  </li>
                  <li>Contact us for further information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If you would like to find out more about the different categories of information collected, please review the data collection
                  section. When a visitor provides personal information to us, we use it in connection with the
                  purposes for which it was provided to us, as stated at the point of collection (or as obvious
                  from the context of collection).  This data is not shared with other entities in the network
                  for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party other than as described in
                  this statement or otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If there is an instance where
                  such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand. Sustify
                  makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data. If a visitor
                  believes the site has collected excessive information, we encourage the visitor to contact us
                  at Sonja.Westphal@sustify.de to raise any concerns. Sustify will not use personal data collected from
                  our websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities.

                </p>
                <h4>Third parties</h4>
                <p>
                  It is Sustify's policy only to disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle; list-style-position: inside;">
                  <li>As required by law through subpoena, search warrant or other legal process
                  </li>
                  <li> When explicitly requested by a visitor
                  </li>
                  <li>When required to deliver publications or reference materials requested by a visitor</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                  Sustify websites do not collect or compile personally identifying information for dissemination or sale to outside parties
                  for consumer marketing purposes, or host mailings on behalf of third parties. Personal data collected
                  by Sustify may be transferred or disclosed to third party service providers (and their subcontractors
                  and subsidiaries) who process information on Sustify’s behalf. These service providers, subcontractors
                  and subsidiaries include providers of information technology, identity management, website hosting
                  and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services. They may be located
                  outside the country where a visitor is located. As a result, a visitor’s information may be transferred
                  outside the country where they’re located.

                </p>

                <h4>Third parties links</h4>
                <p>
                  There may be links to other websites that do not operate under Sustify.de’s privacy practices. When you follow links to other websites, Sustify's privacy practices no longer apply. We encourage visitors to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.
                </p>


                <h4>Data retention</h4>
                <p>
                  Contact information about visitors will be kept as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Email information is kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor's requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.
                </p>

                <h4>Managing Analytics cookies</h4>
                <p>You can opt-out of having your anonymised browsing history within our website recorded by analytics cookies. We use the following service provider and you can learn more about the privacy policies and how to opt-out of their analytics cookies by clicking on the following link:
                  Google Analytics: https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html
                </p>


                <h4>Choices</h4>
                <p>
                  As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the Sustify websites. In certain cases in the future, as your Sustify website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain business confidential or proprietary information services on premium websites.
                  Personally identifiable information provided to Sustify through this website is provided voluntarily by visitors. Should visitors subsequently choose to unsubscribe from any registrations, we will provide instructions on the appropriate website area or in communications to our visitors; or a visitor may contact us at Sonja.Westphal@sustify.de.
                </p>

                <h4>Access</h4>
                <p>
                  Each visitor has the right of access to personal data they have submitted through the websites to Sustify.
                  User updates of information should be handled by going back through the registration process. Inquiries about the accuracy of identifying information previously submitted to Sustify through this website, or requests to have outdated information removed, should be directed to Sonja.Westphal@sustify.de. Sustify is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to visitors to allow them the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccuracies. When requested and practical, Sustify will delete identifying information from current operational systems.
                  When Sustify retains personally identifiable information, Sustify assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified the data. Sustify does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information. When practically possible, if Sustify is informed that any personal data collected through a website is no longer accurate, Sustify will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the authenticated visitor.

                </p>

                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>
                  Sustify has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. </p>

                <h4>Children</h4>
                <p>
                  Sustify understands the importance of protecting children's privacy especially in an online environment. This website is not intentionally designed for or directed at children 13 years of age or younger. It is Sustify's policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.
                </p>
                <h4>Modifications</h4>
                <p>
                  Sustify reserves the right to modify or amend this Statement at any time by publishing an updated version here. The current version of the statement will be accessible on this website
